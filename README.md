## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use JavaScript and have accessibility in mind when building web pages and widgets. I also learned how to position images in an element for different viewport sizes.
I still have to get better at positioning images as this challenge was quite difficult to do.

### Useful resources

- [WAI-Aria Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) - This documentation helped me to understand better about accessibility and design patterns in which the accordion was implemented.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This is an amazing site to learn about web technologies. This one is about JavaScript and it's an excellent resource for newcomers.
